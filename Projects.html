<h4> Application of Genetic Algorithms for the design of Metamaterial Band Pass Filters (SURGE IITK) <a href = "SURGE_IITK.pdf">[Report]</a></h4>
The objective of this project was to understand the application of Genetic Algorithm in the 
optimisation of design of CRLH Transmission Line (TL) Metamaterials. Metamaterials are a class of 
materials which exhibit properties not found in naturally occurring materials. Left Handed 
Metamaterials(LHMs) have negative permittivity and permeability. The basic unit of a metamaterial is 
known as a unit cell. LHMs can be realised by a CRLH TL. For a metamaterial to be used for a specific 
application, its unit cell has to be designed and optimized to get the desired performance. It has been found that using metamaterial zeroth order resonators (ZORs) one 
can realise narrow microwave band pass filters with size reduction of about 60% as compared to 
conventional RH filters. Genetic Algorithms are used for optimization purpose. These algorithms 
work their principle from natural genetics. The advantage of using GA is that a GA search converges 
to a global maxima rather than other gradient based classical optimisation which converge to local 
maxima. In this work, GAs were used for two applications, (i) to optimize the design of unit cell to 
make it balanced and (ii) to optimise the design of metamaterial band pass filter to minimise the 
insertion loss.
